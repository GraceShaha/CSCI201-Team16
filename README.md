About The Project: 
  Our final project is a school club management web application. The app will allow clubs to manage their events on a calendar with notes and/or to-do lists, and an attendance tracker.

Features: 
  User Authentication: Users can register or log in as a club member or continue as a guest. Access is role-specific. 
  Event Calendar: Displays all upcoming and past events in a visual calendar format.
  Event Cards: Each event includes name, date, time, location, agenda, and attendance stats.
  CRUD Functionality: Club members can create, edit, or delete events. Guests have view-only access. 
  Attendance Tracking: Members can RSVP for events. Past events show attendance metrics.

What I Learned: 
  This project was my first experience working with React and Node.js, since our CSCI 201 coursework primarily focused on using Java servlets for backend communication with a database.   While I was primarily part of the frontend team, I also implemented a few custom servlets myself to fetch the data I needed for the UI.
  During the planning phase, we used Figma to collaboratively design the interface and ensure consistency across our components before development began.

Applications Used: 
  Frontend: React, VSCode.
  Backend: Java Servlets, Eclipse. 
  Database: MySQL, MySQL Workbench.
  Design: Figma. 

We received a 100% on this final project for CSCI 201! âœ…
